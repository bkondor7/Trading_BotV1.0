This project is a machine learning-based paper trading bot that uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices.
It is built using Python, Flask for the web interface, and Alpaca for paper trading.
The bot fetches historical stock data, trains an LSTM model to predict future prices, and then places simulated trades based on these predictions.
